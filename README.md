# Bitcoin Critiques & Rebuttals

## Bitcoin Has No Intrinsic Value

> ***Bitcoin is entirely digital & not backed by anything and thus has no intrinsic value.***

**Rebuttal**
```
Mankind evaluates every invention based on its utility for a particular purpose. Bitcoin proves its value by continuing to maintain superior monetary characteristics over current forms of money - backed by advanced cryptography and the most resilient computer network in existence.

  <summary>Detailed rebuttal</summary>

  For supporters, Bitcoin's intrinsic value lies in the fact that it is an **uncorrelated asset**, its intangible properties (**immutable**, **open**, **borderless**, **decentralized**, **censorship-resistant**, etc.), its **scarcity**, and its **utility**.

  For the first time in history, anyone in the world with an internet connection can function as **their very own bank** while participating in the economy with **full control of their wealth**.

  The seven characteristics of money are **durability**, **portability**, **divisibility**, **uniformity**, **limited supply**, and **acceptability**. Many bitcoin proponents adamantly believe that **bitcoin checks all of these boxes** and is therefore hard money with real intrinsic value.

  Oftentimes, those who ascribe zero intrinsic value to bitcoin have done so by way of imperfect knowledge, a narrow perspective, and/or old-aged frameworks that under-represent, if not misrepresent, the capabilities of bitcoin and the very idea of "value".
