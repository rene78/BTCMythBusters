# Bitcoin Critiques & Rebuttals

## Bitcoin Has No Intrinsic Value

> ***Bitcoin is entirely digital & not backed by anything and thus has no intrinsic value.***

**Rebuttal**
```
Mankind evaluates every invention based on its utility for a particular purpose. Bitcoin proves its value by continuing to maintain superior monetary characteristics over current forms of currency - backed by advanced cryptography and the most resilient computer network in existence.
```
<details>

  <summary>Detailed rebuttal</summary>

  For supporters, Bitcoin's intrinsic value lies in the fact that it is an **uncorrelated asset**, its intangible properties (**immutable**, **open**, **borderless**, **decentralized**, **censorship-resistant**, etc.), its **scarcity**, and its **utility**.

  For the first time in history, anyone in the world with an internet connection can function as **their very own bank** while participating in the economy with **full control of their wealth**.

  The seven characteristics of money are **durability**, **portability**, **divisibility**, **uniformity**, **limited supply**, and **acceptability**. Many bitcoin proponents adamantly believe that **bitcoin checks all of these boxes** and is therefore hard money with real intrinsic value.

  Oftentimes, those who ascribe zero intrinsic value to bitcoin have done so by way of imperfect knowledge, a narrow perspective, and/or old-aged frameworks that under-represent, if not misrepresent, the capabilities of bitcoin and the very idea of "value".

## Bitcoin is only used by criminals

> ***Bitcoin is used by drug dealers, money launderers and ransomware attackers; therefore it is bad.***

**Rebuttal**
```
Independent reports suggest that the illicit use of Bitcoin is not higher than in the traditional banking system. Like any useful technology Bitcoin can be utilized to do good or harm.
```
<details>

  <summary>Detailed rebuttal</summary>

  It is unlogical to say that Bitcoin is only used for criminal activities while at the same time denying its usability as money for all of us.

  Studies show that BTC is not excessively used for illegal activities, e.g. former CIA intelligence analyst Micheal Morell concluded in his research that **only about 1%** of all Bitcoin transactions can be **linked to illegal actions**. <sup id="criminals-link-to-footnote1">[1](#criminals-footnote1)</sup>.

Possible questions (To be expanded):

## The Government Will Shut Bitcoin Down

> ***Governments will not allow a competing currency which they cannot control.***

**Rebuttal**
```
The decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes it impossible even for governments to eliminate it completely. By trying, companies in these countries could lose the ability to compete in a financial sector completely reshaped by cryptocurrencies.
```
<details>

  <summary>Detailed rebuttal</summary>

  More and more influential individuals and companies <sup id="shut-down-link-to-footnote1">[1](#shut-down-footnote1)</sup> are invested and believe in the cryptocurrency. El Salvador was the first country to declare Bitcoin as legal tender <sup id="shut-down-link-to-footnote2">[2](#shut-down-footnote2)</sup>. This rapidly evolving trend makes it increasingly difficult to prevent the further propagation without provoking counter-reactions.

## Bitcoin is Too Volatile

> ***Bitcoin is too volatile in order to use it as a currency or store-of-value.***

**Rebuttal**
```
Bitcoin is a young, uncorrelated asset that has risen rapidly in value and will be in the price discovery phase for many years to come. In addition, Bitcoin's volatility decreases as it gathers greater maturity and adoption.
```
<details>

  <summary>Detailed rebuttal</summary>

  At this point in time, as Bitcoin has already achieved a considerable market capitalization but is still several orders of magnitude below a global store of value, it makes sense to consider it as an emerging store of value.

  If Bitcoin ever reaches the status of a world reserve currency it can be assumed that the price will develop in tandem with the world economy.

  But even nowadays, when push comes to shove, Bitcoin's "volatility" is barely noticeable when compared to a hyperinflationary currency.
